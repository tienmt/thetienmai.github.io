# The Tien Mai

Hello! My name is The Tien MAI. (MAI Thế Tiến in Vietnamese)

From Sep. 2017, I am a postdoct at Department of Biostatisitcs, 
University of Oslo (UiO), Norway. (working with Jukka Corander)

Before that I did my PhD in statistics at CREST, ENSAE, University Paris Saclay.
I'd moved to ENSAE-ParisTech since Oct 2015 from University College Dublin 
and Insight Centre for Data Analytics, IReland.



"After rain comes fair weather!"
 
## Research topics:
* Biostatistics: bacterial GWAS: estimation and prediction, genetic characteristics of phenotype(s): heritability, genetic co-variability,
drug sensivetivity prediction with multi-omics data,
* Statistical machine learning: High-dimension sparse regression, Transfer learning and Lifelong learning, Matrix completion, low-rank matrix estimation, Bayesian inference and PAC-Bayesian analysis,

_Apart from research and academics, I enjoy reading stories, watching beautiful things. :D
Politically, I am neutral and I do not follow any religion, except perhaps science. :)
Look around to know more about my research and interests._

## Award:
Young Researcher Award (2016) from the International Society of Non-Parametric Statistics at the 3rd ISNPS comference in Avignon, France.
